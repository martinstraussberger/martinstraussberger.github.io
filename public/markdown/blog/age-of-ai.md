# Summary: Why This Exercise is Valuable

This two-step exercise is designed to transform how you interact with AI tools like Gemini or ChatGPT. Instead of treating them as simple search engines, you will establish a personalized, collaborative relationship. By clearly defining your role, objectives, and working style, you enable the AI to provide highly relevant, concrete, and actionable support. The exercise forces the AI to move beyond vague promises and identify its specific strengths, weaknesses, and limitations for your unique context. Ultimately, this process equips you with reusable prompts and a clear understanding of how to delegate tasks effectively, verify outputs, and integrate AI as a powerful, reliable assistant in your daily workflow.

## Step 1: Introduce Yourself

Open Gemini, ChatGPT, or any other AI Tool and send the model a short brief about yourself.

Include the following:

* **Your Role and Responsibilities:** What is your job title and what do you do?
* **Your Objectives:** What are your key goals for the next quarter?
* **Your Preferred Working Style:** How do you like to communicate and receive information (e.g., format, speed, depth)?
* **Relevant Context:** Add any other details that will help the AI understand how it can assist you (e.g., tools, constraints).

**Here’s an example:**

> I’m Sam, a Product Manager for a B2B SaaS platform.
>
> * **Responsibilities:** I set the product roadmap, write specifications, align with engineering and design teams, and ensure we ship features on time.
> * **Next-quarter Objectives:**
>     1. Launch a self-serve onboarding flow.
>     2. Increase user activation from 25% to 40%.
>     3. Reduce the user's time-to-value to under 5 minutes.
> * **Working Style:** I prefer concise, document-style answers, often in numbered lists. I value data-backed insights and need a fast turnaround.
> * **Constraints:** We primarily use Jira, Figma, and Mixpanel. All outputs must be GDPR-compliant, and we currently have limited design bandwidth.
>
> Nice to meet you. Wait for further instructions.

## Step 2: Get to Know the Model

Now that the AI knows who you are, it’s time to find out what it can do for you.

1. **Discover High-Value Use Cases:**
    Start by asking it to surface concrete, ready-to-execute tasks, not vague promises.
    * **Prompt:** `Given my role, can you think about high-value tasks you can fully handle for me today?`

2. **Align on Collaboration:**
    Dig deeper to align on format, communication style, and frequency.
    * **Prompt:** `What is the best way to work together?`

3. **Define Delegation Boundaries:**
    Knowing what *not* to use it for is just as important as knowing what to hand off.
    * **Prompt:** `What should I delegate to you versus do myself?`

4. **Understand Its Limitations:**
    Force the model to define its own guardrails and expose its weak spots.
    * **Prompt:** `What are your biggest limitations I should be aware of?`
    * **Follow-up Prompt:** `What mistakes do you often make when helping someone in my role?`

5. **Learn to Verify Its Work:**
    Ask the model to teach you how to spot errors in its own output.
    * **Prompt:** `How should I verify your output before using it?`

6. **Equip Yourself with Reusable Tools:**
    To wrap up, ask the AI to create assets you can use repeatedly.
    * **Prompt:** `Can you give me a set of prompt templates I can reuse for my weekly work?`

## Reflect

Take a few minutes to reflect on the interaction.

* What surprised you about what the AI can (or can’t) do?
* Were the answers concrete and useful, or vague and generic?
* Did you discover a few tasks you could start handing off immediately?
* Where in your day-to-day work could this tool slot in?

Write down 2–3 ideas while they are fresh. The goal isn’t just to “try the tool”—it’s to make it work for you.
