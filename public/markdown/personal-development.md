# How I approach my Goals

As a fan of personal development, I firmly believe investing a couple of hours per day into ourselves is crucial. After all, it's time to take control of our lives and not let our inner temptations play the game for us. 

That's why I've created a **Timeboxing Model** that's free, accessible, and built with HTML and CSS, so you too can harness the power of time management. They say time is money, but I say it's worth even more. 

Every hour that passes without valuing it is a lost opportunity. An hour lost is not just a missed opportunity but a depletion of the precious and limited time we have on this unique planet. So, let's make the most of every minute with the help of the Timeboxing concept.

I can personally attest to its effectiveness and its positive impact on my daily goals and life aspirations. For example, building this website and rescuing a lost puppy from Morocco were two monumental tasks while working full-time. We fought and organized for five months bringing the puppy to Germany, undergo the blood test procedures, and satisfy all government requirements. 

To sum up, we do not regret our decision, despite the bunch of work and obstacles.

So why not give it a shot? ðŸš€

The first challenge is sticking to it, but trust me, it's worth it. After all, the only thing standing between you and your dreams is the time you choose to invest in yourself. ðŸ™ƒ

## In short, what is Timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a time management technique where a specific amount of time is allocated for a task or activity. The goal is to increase focus and productivity. A Timeboxing Model involves setting clear, achievable goals for each cluster and sticking to the designated time frame. A cluster is called Timeslot.

It helps to prioritize tasks and manage time more effectively, reducing the risk of procrastination and distractions. Additionally, regularly reviewing and adjusting the time allocations can lead to continuous improvement and optimization of the model and your mindset.
