<!-- I have always been driven by a passion for technology and creativity. As a Web and Mobile Developer, I am constantly inspired by the possibilities of the digital world. With a strong belief in the power of Design Thinking and User Research, I have sharpened my skills over the past three years by creating Design Systems and building my personal component library using Storybook to iterate faster through reusable and existing component concepts. I am eager to bring my passion and expertise to the forefront and make a meaningful impact through my work.

My journey in Frontend Engineering began during my studies in Mechanical Engineering when I discovered my passion for Software Engineering in my second and third semesters through a course on Computer Science for Mechanical Engineers. The first project I worked on, an "Automated Ant Game," sparked my interest in Web Development.

To further develop my skills, I took several online courses on Udemy, and upon completing my studies, I enrolled in Software Engineering at the Code University of Applied Sciences.

The program's hands-on approach, working with corporate partners and completing 15-week projects per semester, deepened my knowledge and expertise, particularly in Frontend Engineering using technologies such as React, Typescript, MongoDB, Node.js, CSS, SCSS, and HTML.

Over the past two years, I have put my skills into practice by working for a company called ehealth-tec GmbH. I have had the opportunity to learn from my teammates and participate in advanced training in Frontend Engineering, including setting up a Cypress E2E Docker environment for our software and implementing over 100 E2E tests. In partnership with the Business Owner, Product Owner, and our customers, I planned and implemented a new Design System using Figma also a Micro-Frontend Architecture for our new application written in React, D3.js, Jest, Typescript, and API-Platform to communicate with the Backend.

With the help of our R&D process with our customers, we were able to develop a fully functional application with real-time interactive and dynamic charts. With over 8 years of practical experience, I am eager to apply my skills to your business, accelerating the research and development process from scratch to a fully functional Application, beyond just an MVP. -->
