Leading as a **Head of Development** is more than just about codeâ€”it's supporting your team & creating the environment to thrive! With over 8 years of experience, I apply my understanding of neuroscience for leadership to build teams that thrive on collaboration and self-leadership.

I also believe that every Leader should focus on self-leadership. In my own pursuits I am always trying to reach out for something new. As I did to become a certified freediver and karate trainer, it allows me to guide teams toward a shared vision with clarity and discipline.
Furthermore, in an age where AI tools are transforming every corner of our environment, the ability to rally teams around a shared vision and customer needs is the ultimate differentiator. I believe that fostering a strong sense of purpose is key.
We focus on delivering applications that solve complex problems and create value for the user which matters. I am passionate about navigating teams to believe in the vision, ensuring our work is both technically excellent and strategically aligned with customer needs.

I enjoy connecting with fellow engineers, researchers, and leaders to share insights and explore new ideas.
