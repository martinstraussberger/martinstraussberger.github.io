### ðŸš€ With over 8 years of practical knowledge in software engineering, I have a deep understanding of the technical challenges required for building great products. But I believe great software is built by thriving teams, not just by great technical solutions.

### That's why Iâ€™ve dedicated more than two years to continuous training in the neuroscience of leadership. This blend of expertise allows me to build environments rooted in psychological safety and trust, fostering teams that are not only collaborative but also deeply motivated by a sense of ownership and belief in the vision.

### ðŸ¥‹ My Philosophy: Leading From The Front I am certain that effective leadership begins with self-leadership.

### This is a principle I practice actively. My experiences becoming a certified freediver and karate trainer have honed my ability to maintain calm under pressure and execute with a clear mind. I bring this same clarity and disciplined mindset to my work.

### ðŸ’¡ The Human Differentiator in the Age of AI In an age where AI tools are transforming every corner of our environment, the ability to rally teams around a shared vision and customer needs is the ultimate differentiator. I am passionate about navigating teams to believe in the vision, ensuring our work is both technically excellent and strategically aligned.

#### I enjoy connecting with fellow engineers, researchers, and leaders to share insights and explore new ideas. Let's [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinstraussberger/)! ðŸ‘‹
