<b> Frontend Development</b>, the art of code <br />
Creating websites that are bold and bestowed <br />
Designs that are user-friendly and sleek <br />
Making the web a place that's easy to seek <br />
<br />
Buttons that are clickable, forms that are neat <br />
Navigation that's simple, can't be beat <br />
Images that are crisp and load fast <br />
Making a website truly built to last <br />
<br />
Without <b>Frontend Developers</b>, the web would be dull <br />
A place where design and functionality are null <br />
So let us all give thanks to those who create <br />
The websites that make our browsing so great!
